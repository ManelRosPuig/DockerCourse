## What is docker?
Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.

### Containers
Containers are a way to package our applications with all the **dependencies** it contains. Containers are very portable. Easy to share between devs and ops.

### Docker Hub
Containers are hosted on **private** or **public** repositories. The most famous public repository is Docker Hub where there are over 100,000 container images from software vendors, open-source projects, and the community. In the docker hub, there are hosted images for example like python, mysql, node and many many more.
