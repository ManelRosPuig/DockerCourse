## What is docker?
Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.

### Containers
Containers are a way to package our applications with all the dependencies it contains. Containers are very portable. Easy to share between devs and ops.
